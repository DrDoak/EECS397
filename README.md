Play function in administrator is broken, hands are not refilled properly. We are aware of this bug.
But... didn't have enough time to fix. Vinay was out of town starting Thursday and just got back this afternoon,
So we didn't really get much time to debug.

Frameworks are there, we did as much as possible given the time restriction

Following Unity conventions:

Source code can be found under Tsuro/Assets/Scripts/

All test cases can be found under Tsuro/Assets/Editor/

MakeFiles mentioned in class today and executables not yet created (we are using the Unity IDE + visual studio for editing).

Test cases can be run using NUnit Library from Visual Studio.
